                <p>
                    There are two main differences between Legal Rights and Fundamental Rights.
                    An ordinary legal right is protected and enforced by the law of land while a Fundamental Right can be taken to the Supreme Court directly. 
                    An ordinary legal right may be changed by the legislature, however, the Fundamental Rights cannot be amended or shortened by any process other than that required for amending the Constitution itself.

                    The Indian Constitution proposes a Parliamentary type of govt. That is structurally federal with some unitary characteristics. The President of India is considered the Constitutional head. According to Article 79 of the Indian Constitution, the council of the Union Parliament comprises two Houses, recognized as the Rajya Sabha or the Council of States and the President besides the Lok Sabha or the House of the People. According to Article 74(1) of the Indian Constitution, the Prime Minister should have a Council of Minister, and he has the right to advise and aid the President. The President will exercise his functions according to the advice. Thus, it can be said that the Council of Ministers can exercise the real executive power, and the Prime Minister will act as its head.

## KANUN - THE OLD IRONSIDES

## Description:
With an abundance of lengthy legal articles and laws, it can be challenging
for citizens to understand their basic rights and responsibilities. To tackle
this issue, Kanun presents a solution with a user-friendly website that
simplifies complex legal information into concise, easy-to-understand
sentences. By simply entering a keyword or problem statement, individuals
can quickly access informative summaries that provide clear explanations
of their rights and obligations. The platform also offers various features
designed to raise awareness and promote understanding of the laws that
govern us.
■The right to justice is a crucial aspect of the 17 United Nations Sustainable

## Development Goals (UN SDGs).
■It is imperative for citizens to have easy access to information regarding
laws and regulations in their country.
■India, being a democratic nation, ensures that every individual's voice is
heard and represented by the government, without discrimination on any
grounds.

articles to keep them informed of current events.
■Our search function allows you to effortlessly navigate through different
categories of laws such as business law, family law, civil law, and more.

included important emergency numbers and frequently asked questions

### (FAQ) pages.
